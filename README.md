# Go-Trains-OTP-Analysis
An independent analysis of Go Train punctuality on the Lakeshore West and East lines. This project collects real-time arrival data via the OpenMetrolinx API and compares it against scheduled timetables to evaluate whether Go Transit's claimed 97.6% on-time performance holds up to commuter standards.
